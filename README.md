# What it does

The **QClock Card** is a configurable word clock in the form of a Home Assistant Lovelace card, which can be customized to your own layout with various settings. Two screenshots are shown here as examples.

* Light Theme:
  ![QClock hell](./images/qclock_light.png)

* Dark Theme:
  ![QClock dunkel](./images/qclock_dark.png)

The clock displays the current time in five-minute increments in word form, with four dots at the bottom marking the minutes "in between".

# Installation

**QClock Card** is a default Lovelace card within HACS. To install it, simply search for it within HACS and add it to your installation. After a Home Assistant restart, the card can be used within the UI.

# Configuration

Once the map has been added to the UI, it can be configured directly there. The following options are available:

* Language
  * German
  * German (¼/¾)
  * English
  * French
  * Italian
  * Spanish
  * Swedish
* Font size
* Shadow / border (checkbox to show or hide the box-shadow around the card)
* Colors
  * Background
  * Sentence start color
  * Current time words color
  * Inactive letters color

Colors can also be selected via the color picker by clicking on the color swatch. Depending on the layout, the map will look like this in edit mode, for example:

* Light Theme:
  ![QClock hell](./images/qclock_config_light.png)

* Dark Theme:
  ![QClock dunkel](./images/qclock_config_dark.png)

  Time words:          "#2c1810" # dark brown
